/// This replaces five per-platform build integrations — a `.podspec` each for
/// iOS and macOS, a `CMakeLists.txt` each for Linux and Windows, and a gradle
/// file plus a third `CMakeLists.txt` for Android — with one file.
///
/// The reason to bother: the CocoaPods registry goes read-only on 2026-12-08,
/// Swift Package Manager is Flutter's default since 3.44, and this plugin has
/// no `Package.swift`. Adding one would answer the question for two of the five
/// platforms and leave the other three on CMake. A build hook is neither a pod
/// nor a Swift package, so the question does not arise on any of them.
///
/// `src/flutter_pty.c` is the only translation unit: it `#include`s
/// `dart_api_dl.c`, `forkpty.c` and whichever of `flutter_pty_unix.c` /
/// `flutter_pty_win.c` applies. Listing the others here as well would define
/// every symbol twice.
